Nav bar and logo:
    How could I have done
    this using percentages
    (or other non fixed
    method) instead of using
    px and guessing until it
    worked?

main section:
    when is it appropriate
    to use a div instead of
    section?

    Why can't width add up to 100%?

    How can I get the about and 
    vision sections to reach all 
    the way to the edge?
